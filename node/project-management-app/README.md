# Google Chat Project Management app

This code sample creates a Google Chat app that helps users manage user stories
in a software development project.

This example creates a Google Cloud Function using a Node.js runtime, which
responds to invocation events from Google Chat.

## Tutorial

For detailed implementation instructions, follow the
[Project Management Tutorial](https://developers.google.com/chat/tutorial-project-management)
in the Google Chat developer documentation.

## Run the sample

To run this sample, you need a Google Cloud
[project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy#projects)
in a Google Workspace account with billing enabled, required APIs turned on, and
authentication set up. You also need to deploy this sample code to a Cloud
Function and configure a Google Chat app using the Cloud Function URL as the
connection endpoint. Once published, add the app to a space and use of the
slash commands to interact with it.
